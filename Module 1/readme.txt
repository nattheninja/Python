Module 1: Hello, world! 		Due: January 30, 2022 11:59 PM

Approach:
In alignment with best practices, I subidvided each assignment into sub parts.
Once identifying the assignment requirements, I simply utilized the learned methods from lecture.

For hello.py, it required a console input and a print statement.
For due_date.py, it required multiple user input, and a print statement that concatenated them.
I ensure all variable initialization and assignment is completed in the beginning of the code.

Known Bugs:
Output is printed as expected.
