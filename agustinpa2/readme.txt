Programming Assignment 2

Compiler/IDE: PyCharm, Python 3.10 Interpreter
Instructions: When running the code, you must ensure your IDE has the Fractions package from the fractions module installed to find the least common denominator of the final nonrecursive cost at each depth. 


Submission includes the following:
1. Behavior Test Folder
	- Contains test runs to measure asymptotic behavior
	- Tests include:
		increasing depth
		changing the nonrecursive cost function 
		changing parameters a and b of recursion function
2. pa.py
	- source code
3. output.py
	- recursion tree output of running pa.py
4. pa2_trace_count.cover
	- shows how many times a line was executed in pa.py
5. test_cases.txt
